This is the third project done at Udacity.
As usual, Udacity gave us the freedom to do whatever we want, 
on a dataset of our choice(giving a few options)
In this project, a detailed analysis has been done on data, using python and its libraries
The dataset is the tmdb-movies.csv dataset (available in the repository)
The project consisted of:
-Data Wrangling & Cleaning (filtering out NaNs, 
			    removing unimportant columns/factors for the analysis,
			    Putting the right data types,
			    Breaking a few strings into lists, etc)
-Analysis with Figures (The questions were designed by me, and the answers too!;) 
			Figures/plots are made to support the answers, and see trends)
-Conclusions Drawn from the analysis (summarising the points,
				      also mentioning possible errors in analysis)
Hope you like it!
